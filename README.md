I'm a **Statistics and Data Science** student at **UCLA** with minors in **Public Health** and **Digital Humanities**, passionate about applying AI and analytics to solve real-world challenges. Currently, I'm building AI agents and metadata systems at NBCUniversal, helping improve knowledge access and governance across large-scale media operations. I‚Äôm also deepening my machine learning expertise through Cornell's ML Foundations program, tackling real-world projects like NLP, dashboarding, and civic tech. My goal is to design equitable, high-impact technologies in healthcare, education, and media by blending data, storytelling, and purpose. I‚Äôm always learning how to turn complex systems into actionable, human-centered solutions.
